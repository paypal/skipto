# skipto@4.1

## by PayPal Accessibility Team & University of Illinois

See the [Authors](#authors) section for more information.

SkipTo is a replacement for your old classic "Skip To Main Content" link, (so please use it as such)!
The SkipTo script creates a drop-down menu consisting of the links to important landmarks and headings on a given web page identified by the author. Once installed and configured, the menu makes it easier for keyboard and screen reader users to quickly jump to the desired region of a page by simply choosing it from the list of options.

### Benefits

* Modern way to conform to the "[Bypass Blocks](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#bypass-blocks)" requirement of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/).
* Screen reader users can get a higher level navigation menu without having to use the screen reader landmark and header navigation commands which typically include longer lists of lower level headings and less used landmarks.
* Keyboard only users can more efficiently navigate to content on a page.
* Speech recognition users can use the menu to more efficiently navigate to content on a page.
* When the "Skip To Content" menu button is visible when the page is loaded everyone can use it to identify and navigate to important regions on a page.
* Authors can configure SkipTo to identify the most important regions, ideally about 7-12 items to make it easier for people to read the list and choose an option.  Remember the more items, the longer it will take for the user to identify which item they want to choose.

## Websites using SkipTo

There are two main ways to use the menu button for SkipTo in a page.  In the default configuration the menu button is always visible making it useful to everyone to easily find and navigate to the important content regions identified by the author.  This is similar to how curb cuts help more than just people using wheelchairs.  It is also easier for people using voice recognition to activate the button using the "click skip to content" command and use similar voice commands to activate SkipTo menu items.  The "popup" option is the more traditional approach to fulfilling the "[bypass bocks](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#bypass-blocks)" requirement of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/), but this option makes the feature less visible to people who might benefit.

* [Functional Accessibility Evaluator (FAE)](https://fae.disability.illinois.edu/)
* [Study Abroad Program for College of Education](https://studyabroad.education.illinois.edu)

NOTE: Popup menu button option is available through configuration of SkipTo when it is loaded.

## How it works

1. The SkipTo menu button should be the first tabable element on the page, and by default the button is visible, but can be configured to "popup" when the button becomes receives focus.
2. Once the keyboard focus is on the menu button, pressing the ENTER, SPACE, DOWN ARROW or UP ARROW keys will pull down the list of important landmarks and headings on the page.  The button is based on the ARIA Authoring Practice [design pattern for menu button](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#menubutton).
3. Use arrow keys to select your choice and press ENTER to move focus to the section of the page.
4. If you decide to reach the menu again, simply press the built-in access key (0 by default). See the notes on [Access keys](#access-keys) for More information on how to use them.

## Shortcut key

A shortcut key can be used to open the SKipTo menu from anywhere on the page.  Version 4.2 changes the shortcut key operation from using the HTML `accesskey` attribute to use a scripted method to improve consistency of the accesskey between broswers and support screen reader users.  Some screen readers do not support the use of accesskeys. For example, to use the "SkipTo" shortcut key, you would press either `alt + 0` (Windows/Unix/Linux) or `Option + 0` (macOS).  macOS does not have an ALT key, so uses the Option key as the modifier.  The access keys are the same for Firefox, Chrome and Safari on the same operating system.


* `Alt + 0` : Windows, Unix and Linux.
* `Option + 0` : macOS.

NOTE: Browsers on iOS and iPadOS devices support `accesskey` to move focus to the menu button, but do not support the menu button keyboard commands to use the menu at this time.  Browsers on Android devices do not support `accesskey`s at this time.

## Adding to Website

All you need are either skipto.js or skipto.min.js from the "downloads/js" directory. Please note that skipto.min.js is a minified (a lighter version) of the script.
If you would like to be able to debug your production-ready script, include the provided skipto.min.js.map file as well.

### Local File on Your Web Server

Copy the `skipto.js` or `skipto.min.js` to the file system of your web server and reference it from your web page or templates using a `script` tag, as follows:

```html
<script src="https://[path to Javascript files]/skipto.min.js"></script>
```

### CDN Service

The easiest way is to include a reference to `skipto.min.js`  on your HTML page or template is through the CDN service, as follows:

```html
<script src="https://paypal.github.io/skipto/downloads/js/skipto.min.js"></script>
```

NOTE: CDN referenced files may not be available to computers behind firewall protected networks.

### What About Joomla?

Joomla 4.0 includes **skipto** as a default plugin

## Configure Options

All settings have a default value, a configuration object can be used to change the default values.

### Options for adding the `button` element

The following options are useful for identify where the menu will be in the DOM structure of the page and which elements will be used as the container for the menu button.  The options are of type `string`.

| Property       | default     | Description |
| :------------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| `displayOption` | 'static' | Values of `static`, `fixed` or `popup` are defined.  The value `static` the button is always visible, the value `fixed` the button is always visible at the top of the page even when the page scrolls, and the value `popup` is used the button is initially not visible, but becomes visible when it receives focus. |
| `accessKey` | '0' | [Accesskey](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/accesskey) provides a way to open the Skip To menu from anywhere on the page, the default is the number zero. |
| `attachElement` | 'header' | A CSS selector for identifying which element to attach the menu button container.  If the `header` element is not present, it will use the `body` element as the default.|
| `containerElement` | 'div' | Element to use as a container for the button and the menu.
| `customClass` | none | CSS class added to the container element. Can be used for customize styling of the button and menu with author supplied stylesheet. |

| `fontSize` | CSS font size | `inherit`  | Set the CSS `font-size` using the configuration object. |
| `fontFamily` | CSS font string | `inherit`  | Set the CSS `font-family` using the configuration object. |

### CSS Selectors for identifying Landmarks and Headings

The `landmarks` and 'headings' options are CSS selectors used to identify the important landmarks and headings on the page for the purpose of keyboard navigation.  The list of landmarks and headings should be **relatively short**, the more items the menu contains the more time the user will need to scan and navigate to the section they want to "skip to".

The options are of type `string`.

| Property       | Default | Description |
| :------------- | :------ | :---------- |
| `landmarks` | 'main, [role="main"], [role="search"], nav, [role="navigation"], aside, [role="complementary"]' | A set of CSS selectors used by `querySelectorAll` to get an array of landmark elements. |
| `headings` | 'main h1, [role="main"] h1, main h2, [role="main"] h2' | A set of CSS selectors used by `querySelectorAll` to get an array of heading elements. |

### Color Theme Options

A color theme sets all the color options defined by the theme.  There is only one theme at this time.

NOTE: Make sure colors meet the color contrast requirements of WCAG 2.1 for text

### Heading Shortcuts and Action Menu Options

The inclusion of heading level shortcut keys and the more landmarks and more headings action buttons are enabled by default, but they can be disabled through configuration.  The values are of type boolean.

## Example Settings

If have different requirements for your web site and include other heading levels as well as ARIA landmarks, you will need to provide a JSON object containing the necessary configuration parameters. The following is a sample configuration:

```html
<script>
var SkipToConfig =  {
  'settings': {
    'skipTo': {
      landmarks: 'main, [role="main"], [role="search"], nav',
      headings: 'main h1, main h2, main h3',
      colorTheme: 'illinois'
    }
  }
};
</script>
```

### HTML, Classes and Ids for custom styling

The source code in this section is for developers to understand the HTML, classes and ids used in the SkipTo menu button and menu for use in custom styling.

```html
<div
  class="skip-to"
  title='Keyboard Navigation Accesskey is "Alt+0"'
>
  <!--
  //
  // Menu Button
  //
  -->
  <button
    aria-haspopup="true"
    aria-expanded="true"
    aria-label="Skip to content, shortcut Alt plus 0">
    Skip To Content (Alt+0)
  </button>
  <!--
  //
  // ARIA enabled menu
  //
  -->
  <div role="menu">
    <!--
    //
    // Landmark group label and menu items
    //
    -->
    <div id="id-skip-to-group-landmarks-label"
      role="separator">
      Important Landmarks
    </div>
    <div role="group"
      aria-labelledby="id-skip-to-group-landmarks-label" id="id-skip-to-group-landmarks">
      <div role="menuitem"
        class="landmark skip-to-main skipto-nesting-level-0"
        data-id="1">
        <span class="label">Main</span>
      </div>
      <div role="menuitem"
        class="landmark skip-to-nav skipto-nesting-level-0"
        data-id="2">
        <span class="label">Navigation: SkipTo test pages</span>
      </div>
      <!--
      ... more menu items ...
      -->
    </div>
    <!-- End Landmarks Group -->

    <!--
    //
    // Heading group label and menu items
    //
    -->
    <div id="id-skip-to-group-headings-label"
      role="separator">
      Important Headings
    </div>
    <div role="group"
      aria-labelledby="id-skip-to-group-headings-label"
      id="id-skip-to-group-headings">
      <div role="menuitem"
        class="heading skip-to-h1"
        data-id="9"
        data-level="1">
        <span class="level"><span>1</span>)</span>
        <span class="label">Example Content</span>
      </div>
      <div role="menuitem"
        class="heading skip-to-h2"
        data-id="10"
        data-level="2">
        <span class="level"><span>2</span>)</span>
        <span class="label">Pastrami</span>
      </div>
      <!--
      ... more menu items ...
      -->
    </div>
    <!-- End Headings Group -->
  </div>
</div>


```

### Notes

* Parameters are optional.
* SkipTo will be attached to the `header`element as the first child by default.  If the `header`element is not present, it will be attached as the first child of the `body` element on the page.  The attachment can be changed using the "attachElement" parameter.
* When the custom class is specified (see the customClass parameter), the user can override the style:

```css
.skip-to.MyCustomClass {
  background:  red;
  left: 50px;
  top: 50px;
}
```

## Compiling CSS and JavaScript

You may feel slightly adventurous and decide to change some colors or even enhance the script with your changes. Once you do this, here is how you compile the skipTo script for production.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/paypal/skipto.git
cd skipto
sudo npm install grunt-cli -g
npm install
grunt
```

1. You should now have a directory called **`downloads`** with the necessary files in it.
1. See instructions above on which files you need to get the SkipTo script running on your web site.

Note: On Windows, build-win.bat runs npm install and grunt modules (Step 3). To successfully run, you must launch a Windows command prompt as an Admin (Ctrl+Shift+Enter) and then run build-win.bat from this command prompt.

## Cleaning up

If you would like to revert your local code repository to its initial state, simply run

```sh
grunt clean
```

from the root directory of your repository.

## Of course, we want feedback

Please do not hesitate to [raise issues and comment on Github](https://github.com/paypal/skipto/issues) if something doesn't work or you have ideas on how to improve the script.

Happy skipping!
